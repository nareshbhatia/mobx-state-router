MobX-powered router for React apps.

## Features

-   State is decoupled from the UI. UI is simply a function of the state.
-   UI is no longer responsible for fetching data. Data is now fetched during
    state transitions using router hooks.
-   The router can override routing requests based on the application state. For
    example, it can redirect to the Sign In page if the user is not logged in.
-   Supports
    -   404 (Not Found) errors
    -   Server-Side Rendering

## Contributors

Make sure all your commit messages conform to the
[Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

To simplify this process, we have included
[Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) as a dependency of this
project. Always execute the following command sequence to commit your changes.
It will prompt you to fill out any required commit fields interactively.

```
git add --all
yarn cz-commit # interactive conventional commit
git push
```

## Release to NPM

1. Change the version number in package.json. Use semver. For pre-release
   versions add a suffix & build number, e.g 5.0.0-beta.1.

2. Commit and push (see above)

3. Build the package

    yarn build:local

4. Release to npm

    npm publish # for normal release npm publish --tag next # if doing a
    pre-release

5. Tag the release and push the tag to remote

## Credits

mobx-state-router is based on ideas from several Open Source projects. I am
grateful to the developers of these projects for their contributions. Special
thanks go to the following contributions:

[How to decouple state and UI (a.k.a. you donâ€™t need componentWillMount)](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-decouple-state-and-ui-a-k-a-you-dont-need-componentwillmount-cc90b787aa37)\
This article by [Michel Weststrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate) provided the
initial inspiration for writing mobx-state-router. It explains the downsides of mixing
State and UI and how to untangle the mess!

[mobx-router](https://github.com/kitze/mobx-router)\
This library by [Kitze](https://github.com/kitze) is a good implementation of Michel
Weststrate's ideas. I have borrowed some concepts from this implementation and then
added my own. Thanks Kitze!

[router5](https://github.com/router5/router5)\
This is a more extensive library for routing. It's unique feature is that routes
are organized as a tree, made of segments and nodes. It aims to be framework agnostic
and uses middleware and plugins to adapt to different frameworks. Of course, with
flexibility comes complexity. mobx-state-router makes some choices for you to keep
the overall learning curve simple.
